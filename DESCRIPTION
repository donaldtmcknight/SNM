Description: Calculating home ranges and movements of animals in complex stream environments
    is often challenging, and standard home range estimators do not apply. This
    package provides a series of tools for assessing movements in a stream
    network, such as calculating the total length of stream used, distances
    between points, and movement patterns over time.
